# GPTO Julia-Heat Conduction

GPTO Julia with Gridap
 
A Julia/Gridap adaptation of the MATLAB code for topology optimization 
with bars using the geometry projection method, modified for solving
heat conduction (or heat diffusion) problem.

Version 0.1.0 -- August 2025

This code is a migration to Julia/Gridap by

<strong>Prabin Pradhananga</strong> <br/>
School of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Manufacturing Engineering <br/>
University of Connecticut <br/>

of PyGPTO (Python/Numpy adaptation of the MATLAB code) for topology optimization 
with bars using the geometry projection method, translated to Python by

<strong>Andres Ortegon</strong> <br/>
Department of Mathematics <br/>
Universidad Nacional de Colombia <br/>

from the GPTO Matlab code written by

<strong>Hollis Smith and Julian Norato</strong> <br/>
Department of Mechanical Engineering <br/>
University of Connecticut <br/>

Special thanks to Sy Nguyen-Van for his Julia code that helped a lot during
this translation.
