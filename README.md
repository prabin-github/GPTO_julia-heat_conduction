# GPTO Julia-Heat Conduction

GPTO Julia with Gridap
 
A Julia/Gridap adaptation of the MATLAB code for topology optimization 
with bars using the geometry projection method, modified for solving
heat conduction (or heat diffusion) problem.

Version 0.1.0 -- August 2025

This code is a migration to Julia/Gridap by
